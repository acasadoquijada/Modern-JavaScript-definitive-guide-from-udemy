This is the first project of the [Modern JavaScript definitive guide Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-moderno-guia-definitiva-construye-10-proyectos/). It consists of a web page developed using javascript that simulates a page similar to Udemy where the user can buy different courses.

The work developed during this project is the following:

* Add the logic necessary to handle the user interactions: add a course, delete a course, delete cart
* Add the js code to modify the HTML according to the user interactions: add course info in the cart, delete course info from the cart.

All this work can be found in [app.js](js/app.js)
